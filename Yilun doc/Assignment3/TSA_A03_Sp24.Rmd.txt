Be sure to use this assignment document. Your report should contain the answer to each question and any plots/tables you obtained (when applicable).","","Please keep this R code chunk options for the report.

The data comes from the US Energy Information and Administration and corresponds to the December 2022 **Monthly** Energy Review.

You may use the some code form A2, but I want all the three plots side by side as in a grid.","(Hint: use function `plot_grid()` from the `cowplot` package)","","### Q2","From the plot in Q1, do the series Total Biomass Energy Production, Total Renewable Energy Production, Hydroelectric Power Consumption appear to have a trend? If yes, what kind of trend?","","### Q3","Use the *lm()* function to fit a linear trend to the three time series. Ask R to print the summary of the regression. Interpret the regression output, i.e., slope and intercept. Save the regression coefficients for further analysis."," ","### Q4","Use the regression coefficients from Q3 to detrend the series. Plot the detrended series and compare with the plots from Q1. What happened? Did anything change?","","### Q5","Plot ACF and PACF for the detrended series and compare with the plots from Q1. You may use plot_grid() again to get them side by side. nut mot mandatory. Did the plots change? How?","","## Seasonal Component","","Set aside the detrended series and consider the original series again from Q1 to answer Q6 to Q8.","","### Q6","Just by looking at the time series and the acf plots, do the series seem to have a seasonal trend? No need to run any code to answer your question. Just type in you answer below.","","### Q7","Use function *lm()* to fit a seasonal means model (i.e. using the seasonal dummies) the two time series. Ask R to print the summary of the regression. Interpret the regression output. From the results which series have a seasonal trend? Do the results match you answer to Q6?","","### Q8","Use the regression coefficients from Q7 to deseason the series. Plot the deseason series and compare with the plots from part Q1.
